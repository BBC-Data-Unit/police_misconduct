# Instructions for use

1. Make sure that the index.Rmd file inside the 'site' folder is up to date. This will be used to generate an index.html page later. Based on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6Ot6gsjpXHf3XZTnvZBgsrOap-WB0dl8ZaCFHQkdKY/edit
2. Run the code in 01forcetemplateMDversion.Rmd to create a template for all the force pages
3. Run the code in 02parameterisationMDversion.Rmd to generate .md versions for each force from that template, inside the 'site' folder.
4. Run the code in 03renderAndClean.Rmd to render those .md pages as HTML versions in the 'site/_site' folder. It will also clean up some HTML. 
5. Upload the resulting HTML pages to https://github.com/sduiopc/test1/tree/branch1 
6. Check the live version at https://sduiopc.github.io/test1/index.html
