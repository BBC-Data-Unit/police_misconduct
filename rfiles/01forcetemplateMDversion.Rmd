We’ve analysed reports into investigations published into the conduct of officers and staff at `r params$force` since the IOPC was formed in 2018.

`r customstring1`

`r customstring2`

`r customstring3`

`r customstring4`

The outcomes were as follows:

* `r bullet1`
* `r bullet2`
* `r bullet3`
* `r bullet4`

`r injurystring`

You can read the reports below.

Please note, these are only the cases where the IOPC judged there was a case to answer for misconduct. Also, in a small number of cases the total number of officers and staff identified did not match the number given sanctions. This is because the outcomes for those individuals were not listed in the report


### Explore the cases

The table below shows misconduct cases involving this force. 

The table does not contain the full text for the IOPC report. Please click on a link to see the full description of the case.

  #let's strip out the square brackets from the tags too
  #we have to escape the square brackets as they're special characters in regex
  subsetdf$tags <- gsub("\\]","",gsub("\\[","",subsetdf$tags))

### Breakdown of cases

The table below shows a breakdown of classifications of misconduct cases.

Every misconduct investigation carried out by the IOPC is given a broad ‘tag’ depending on the type of misconduct being investigated. 

A single investigation can be given multiple tags, which is why there may be more tags than cases in the table listed below. 

Percentages can therefore add up to more than 100% because one case can have more than one tag.

Investigations may be given tags for each force involved. In the table below we have not included the tag for this force, but tags for other forces may appear.

*NB: The tags "child sexual abuse" and "domestic abuse" relate to the way the force handled inquiries into those matters and are not an accusation that the officer has been engaged in behaviour of that sort. Cases of sexually inappropriate behaviour are tagged under "corruption and abuse of power."*


```{r table of cases}
#Create the datatable, adding a filter and setting other options
#Add a caption if you want
DT::datatable(tagsdf, 
              style = 'bootstrap', 
              caption = 'Analysis by the BBC Shared Data Unit. Note: percentages add up to more than 100% because one case can have more than one tag', 
              options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE, bFilter = F)
              ) %>%
  DT::formatPercentage (columns = percheading) 
#see https://rdrr.io/cran/DT/man/formatCurrency.html
```

### IOPC recommendations 

```{r create vars for recoms}
#filter to the columns we want, just recommendations, just this force
recsdf <- justmisconduct %>%
  dplyr::select("Heading", "Content", "Force", "tags","url", "Date", "What.were.the.recommendations.") %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(What.were.the.recommendations.)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Force == params$force) 

#rename the last col
colnames(recsdf)[7] <- "recommendation"

recscount <- nrow(recsdf)
rec1 <- ""
#change the grammar based on the number of recommendations
if (recscount == 1){
  sentence <- paste0(recscount," recommendation")
  #store the recommendation
  rec1 <- paste0("This was: \n\n> *", recsdf$recommendation,"*")
  } else if (recscount > 1){
  sentence <- paste0(recscount," recommendations")
  rec1 <- "For full data, see the recommendations column in the full spreadsheet provided."
  } else {
    sentence <- "no recommendations"
  }


```

The IOPC has made `r sentence` in relation to misconduct cases involving `r params$force`. `r rec1`
