# Police_misconduct
The Shared Data Unit's investigation into misconduct in police forces in England and Wales.

In February 2022, The Shared Data Unit (SDU) looked at the sanctions faced by police officers in misconduct hearings since the latest police watchdog was formed in 2018.

![Police general](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61186777/154043002-c544652b-9851-489b-917c-75d1131e1dec.jpg)

The research found that around one in two police officers had remained in their jobs despite their gross misconduct being proven since then. 

Out of 118 cases where the standards breach was proven by force disciplinary panels, 55 led to the sack.  

The panels were held after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found a case to answer for gross misconduct - the most serious breach of police standards.

The IOPC strategy director said the watchdog did not "always agree" with the sanctions handed out by forces.

But the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers across England and Wales, said a written warning was an "18-month stain" on an officer's record. 


## Methodology

In order to obtain the national figures, we analysed the yearly outcomes report released by the IOPC.

However, the The IOPC reports did not contain details by force, so separately, the BBC examined more than 800 reports into misconduct cases published on the IOPC website. 

From those we narrowed the outcomes down to 244 reports where there was a misconduct or gross misconduct case to answer. We read all of these to find what sanctions were gven to officers and staff and the force they represented.   


## Regional analysis

Out of the 244 officers with a case to answer in our regional analysis:

105 (43%) faced no further action.  Twenty of those had left the force before their hearings were heard, but the majority (77, or 73% of the 105) were found not guilty by a force panel.
87 (36%) received management action
40 officers (16%) were given a written warning
10 officers (4%) were dismissed

Cases involving persistent bullying, the use of racial slurs and deaths of members of the public were among those to see no further action taken.

## Data
